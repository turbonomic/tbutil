---

When running TbUtil in a Turbonomic V8 deployment, we generally recommend deploying as a pod in you Turbonomic instance's Kubernetes name space. Some use cases actually mandate this approach.

A number of pre-defined "flavours" of container are made available which you can either use as-is, or as the base image for a pod of your own design.
